MLB Team Win Probability Predictor
This project scrapes MLB batting and pitching statistics from MLB.com, aggregates the data by team, and uses a machine learning model to predict the probability of one team winning against another. The model is trained using a Random Forest Classifier, and the win probability is calculated based on team statistics.

Overview
The project consists of two main parts:

Web Scraping: Scrapes batting and pitching statistics from MLB.com and saves them into CSV files (MLB_Batting.csv and MLB_Pitching.csv).

Machine Learning: Aggregates the scraped data by team, creates matchups between all teams, and trains a Random Forest Classifier to predict the probability of one team winning against another.

How It Works
Web Scraping:

The script scrapes batting and pitching statistics from MLB.com for multiple pages.

The data is saved into two CSV files: MLB_Batting.csv and MLB_Pitching.csv.

Data Aggregation:

The batting and pitching statistics are aggregated by team.

The aggregated data is merged into a single DataFrame (team_stats).

Matchup Creation:

All possible matchups between teams are created.

Features for each matchup are generated by combining the statistics of the two teams.

Machine Learning:

A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the matchup data.

The model predicts the probability of one team winning against another.

Prediction:

A function predict_win(team_a, team_b) is provided to predict the win probability for any two teams.
